    <p class="fourteen"><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>
    <p class="one">Helvetica light</p>
    <p class="two">Georgia</p>
    <p class="three">Open Sans</p>
    <p class="four">
      The reason why I chose these fonts is because they are simple and
      sophisticated which is the look i am going for for this site. Open Sans is
      a very standard font and is not hard to read. I have made most of the
      headings big in size, and all text is presented in a fairly reasonable
      size font. Georgia is not so different from Open Sans either they are
      bothe legible and readable i made use of this font mainly to highlight
      some sub headings. And lastly Helvetica light which much like all the
      other fonts is also simple. All these fonts cater well to people who might
      have trouble with their eyesight as the fonts characters are easily
      identified.

    <p class="fourteen"><strong>Colour Palette:</strong></p>
    <p class="six">rgb(116, 114, 114);</p>
    <p class="eight">black</p>
    <p class="nine">white</p>
    <p class="ten">rgb(245, 242, 242);</p>
    <p class="eleven">rgb(216, 214, 214)</p>
    <p class="thirteen">
      My web pages barely make use of any colour, the dominating colour here is
      black and other colours are brought in through images made available as
      well as other places suchses headings and text which make use of different
      tints of white and black. The reason I opted for a minimalistic and simple
      colour palette is because i noticed that the content of ones page stands
      out more if it is colourful and against a plain background. And this is
      what I am aiming to achieve with my sight. I also like minimalistic
      colours because it moves one away from creating clutter and having too
      much colour on their sight which might prove to be disracting to the
      viewer. I also love the sophistication that comes with the colour black.
