      <p>
        As of right now i do not have much to say about my UX and UI because my
        webiste is at the beginning stages and alot can still change. As of
        right now my site is fairly simple to navigate making use of of little
        to no colour. My site consists mainly of black and white and a little
        splash of colour to make it stand out. the lack of colour gives it a
        sort of elegance and confidence which i feel fits the aesthetic I am
        going for because I am doing music I was aiming for a "Spotify" kind of
        look.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the legibility and readability of the site I would say is
        well done as i made us of fonts that are not hard to read the viewer can
        easily make out the characters of the word and the font is also of
        standard size, for people who might have eyesight problems. Text is
        mostly placed inside containers with a contratsing background and
        padding so that the text does not feel squashed making it hard to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pages on the site make use of consistent visual weight mainly
        symmetrical and radial such as on my blog page where the contents are
        placed in the middle of the page. On the home page the albums are placed
        in straight rows and columns all of the same size.My site also makes use
        of thye smae flow as throughout the site is black with tints of white
        and splashes of colour from images
