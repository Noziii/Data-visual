      <p>
        The article by Li, Q. (2020) Overview of Data Visualization explores the
        relationship between data visualization and aesthetics. Furthermore,
        looking at defining data and information and the types and
        characteristics of traditional data visualization, focusing on
        understanding the meaning of data, and lastly, at some important types
        of data visualizations
      </p>
      <p class="sub"><b>The Concept of Data Visualization</b></p>
      <p>
        With the invention of computers came a big shift in the technology of
        data visualization it went from hand drawing to photo etching, and then
        to using computer-based software and graphics. (Friendly,2009) And also
        made data analysis faster and more precise in this article, data
        visualization that deals with communication for understanding is
        considered traditional data visualization. The importance of data
        visualization is explained as follows: “The success of data
        visualization is due to the soundness of the basic idea behind it: the
        use of computer-generated images to gain insight and knowledge from data
        and its inherent patterns and relationships. A second premise is the
        utilization of the broad bandwidth processes, and simulations involving
        data sets from diverse scientific disciplines and large collections of
        abstract data from many sources.” (Post, Nielson, & Bonneau, 2003, back
        cover)
      </p>
      <p class="sub"><b>The Definition of Data Visualization:</b></p>
      <p>
        Data visualization can be defined using many terms, but most definitions
        focus on the link between data and computer technology which will allow
        the data to be transformed into a visual form. The definition that stood
        out to me in the article was that of Manovich who defines it as the
        “transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual
        representation.” (Manovich, 2010 p20) The majority of the definitions in
        the article mention that there is a visual representation at play
        overall and that is the key point. (Li, 2020)
      </p>
      <p class="sub"><b>The Definition of Data and Information:</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Data-</b> data usually refers to unprocessed information which has no
        meaning or significance and can be displayed in different forms which
        can be useful or not. (Li, 2020 p20-21)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Information-</b> is defined as the “processed” form of data that has
        been developed in such a way that can be understood by humans. (Li, 2020
        p20-21)
      </p>
      <p class="sub"><b>The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization:</b></p>
      <p>
        It is important to select a certain type of data visualization based on
        what you are trying to present. A certain type of form will suit a
        certain type of data or information that needs to be displayed.
        Information visualization and scientific visualization are two
        completely different research fields Information visualization looks at
        the grouping and demonstration of information to people, which is,
        therefore, best suited for tables, charts, trees, maps, scatter plots,
        diagrams, and graphs. Scientific visualization which is the
        representation of data in detail as a means of achieving understanding
        and perception of scientific data is best suited to simulations,
        waveforms, and volume. (Li, 2020 p20-23)
      </p>
      <p><b>Trees:</b></p>
      <p>
        Also referred to as tree-maps, tree-maps work on a hierarchal system
        from the root which then branches out into different sections. Tree maps
        are best suited to display data or information that has a part-to-whole
        relationship. For example, having a whole percentage representing a
        category that will act as the base of the “tree” which will then expand
        off like the branches of the tree and this will be sub-categories to the
        main category and these sub-categories will have their own percentages
        but when added together will equate to the main category “the root”.
        (Li, 2020 p24-26)
      </p>
      <p><b>Maps:</b></p>
      <p>
        A map is defined as a representation of selected characteristics of a
        place or any space and is usually drawn on a flat surface. According to
        the article, most maps are designed into four main maps.
      </p>
      <p>Which are:</p>
      <p>
        1) <b>Political map</b> which can depict territorial borders of
        countries or cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) <b>Physical map</b> that shows features of geography such as
        mountains, land, rivers, railways, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) <b>Geologic map</b> shows numerous environmental features such as
        rock units, bedding planes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>4) <b>Topographic maps</b> present rises and support contour lines.</p>
      <p>
        The come of software and computers has enabled the creation of different
        kinds of maps and moved them from 2D to even 3D where one can view
        places in 3D as if they are there. (Li, 2020 p28-29)
      </p>
      <p><b>Scatter plots: </b></p>
      <p>
        Are the representation of data often based on the Cartesian coordinate
        system they work better with displaying 2part data sets which rely on
        the x or y-axis. The independent variables are plotted across the x-axis
        and the dependent variables on the y-axis the data sets are therefore
        related. (Li, 2020 p28-29) An example would be an Ice cream shop
        displaying data on how many ice creams they sell dependent on the
        temperature on the day. The temperature which is an independent variable
        will be labelled across the x-axis and the amount of ice creams sold is
        a dependent variable and therefore will be displayed on the y-axis.
      </p>
      <p><b>Charts:</b></p>
      <p>
        Are best to represent in line, bar, or slice and these would refer to a
        pie chart, or line chart. These usually represent information according
        to their sizes such as in a bar graph or pie chart. (Li, 2020 p29-30)
        For example, displaying information about what percentage of people like
        a certain color in a pie chart form.
      </p>
      <p><b>Tables:</b></p>
      <p>
        The display of information in tables is most used for comparative data
        placed in categories and mainly uses rows and columns. The columns are
        commonly used to represent the categories and the rows to show the
        actual data related to the category it is placed under or sometimes next
        to. (Li, 2020 p30-31)
      </p>
      <p><b>Diagrams:</b></p>
      <p>
        Are symbolic representations of information using imagining techniques,
        such as a ven diagram, tree diagram etc. (Li, 2020 p32)
      </p>
      <p><b>Graphs:</b></p>
      <p>
        Like a diagram and charts, they are still a visual representation of
        data that can use sizes to communicate information like in a bar graph
        or the inclination or decline in a line graph. (Li, 2020 p33) For
        example, a bar graph depicting how many people out of a hundred like a
        certain song from an album. The highest bar will therefore be the most
        like song.
      </p>
      <p><b>Waveform:</b></p>
      <p>
        Displays data in the form of a signal which suggests the time related to
        the numerous numbers of data. (Li, 2020 p35)
      </p>
      <p><b>Simulation:</b></p>
      <p>
        Is categorized as one of the most useful scientific visualizations it is
        primarily used to display and help people understand natural phenomena
        such as weather changes. (Li, 2020 p37)
      </p>
      <p><b>Volume:</b></p>
      <p>
        Represents data on a 3D grid they are defined as “multidimensional
        arrays of scalar data and vector data which are typically defined on
        lattice structures representing values sampled in a 3D environment.”
        (Li, 2020 p38)
      </p>
      <p class="sub">The Characteristics of Traditional Data Visualization:</p>
      <p>
        1) Information visualization- needs readability meaning that it needs to
        be readable and comprehensible. (Li, 2020 p41)
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Scientific Visualization- “needs to be recognizable from previous
        encounters or knowledge” (Li, 2020 p41)
      </p>
      <p class="sub">Data Visualization and Human Perception:</p>
      <p>
        According to the article how people perceive the data being displayed to
        them can improve the “quality and “quantity” of the information at hand.
        Therefore, rendering it is important that information is displayed
        appropriately with the use of the most appropriate form of data
        visualization best suited for the information that one is trying to
        display. (Li, 2020 p42)
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Most of the reading was fairly simple to understand except I had a
        problem grasping the forms of Waveform, Simulation, and Volume for
        Scientific Visualization. Waveform reminded me of the sound waves from
        music which is the majority of what I saw in some images and examples I
        tried to explain it to myself that the waves will increase and decrease
        at a certain time in the song dependent on how much louder that part of
        the song is the louder the higher the sound waves are. But simulation
        and volume are still a mystery to me even after doing research. I
        realized through this that there are certain types of ways to present
        data and information and but not all forms will be appropriate for your
        data at hand, so it is better to assess the type of forms and what kind
        of data is best suited to each. It is very important that the data
        represented is legible and digestible to people in such a way that it is
        easy for them to understand the information and it is manageable after
        observation.
